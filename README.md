## Features
- **User-Friendly Upload & Predict**: Easily upload MRI images and receive tumor classification results.
- **Multi-Model Architecture**: Utilizes three models (Xception, MobileNet, Custom CNN).
- **Saliency Map Generation**: Visualizes areas of the MRI that influenced the modelâ€™s prediction, enhancing interpretability.
- **Chat with LLM**: A built-in chat with an LLM to explain model predictions and provide insights on tumor types and treatment implications.

## Models
- **Xception (Transfer Learning)**: A robust deep learning model with strong feature extraction capabilities, achieving 98% accuracy in brain tumor classification.
- **MobileNet (Transfer Learning)**: A lightweight and efficient model, optimized for speed, with a 99% accuracy rate.
- **Custom CNN**: A specialized convolutional neural network, fine-tuned for this specific task, delivering 98% accuracy.
